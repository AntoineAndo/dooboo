Command "eas build -p android --profile development" is working and generates an apk that can be installed and launched
Command "adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V" good for logs

    App crashes on startup with error

 Package "transform-inline-environment-variables" added
Dev build ok with "eas build -p android --profile development"
TO FIX - FIXED - But problem during add flow, submission cant complete and stays stuck on the loading screen
TO FIX - Local start with Expo Go not working because env variables are undefined
